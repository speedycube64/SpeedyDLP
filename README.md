This program requires [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases/tag/2024.03.10) to be downloaded and added to "Path" in system environment variables. The "trim video" option requires the same with [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).

To add something to "Path" in Windows:
- Go to Control Panel -> System and Security -> System -> Advanced system settings -> Environment Variables
- Scroll through the system variables and click on "Path"
- Click "Edit"
- In the new window, click "New"
- Paste in the directory where your program is installed (in this case, yt-dlp or ffmpeg)
